    "## A class containing one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class.\n",
    "## Abstract methods do not contain any implementation. \n",
    "## Instead, all the implementations can be defined in the methods of sub-classes that inherit the abstract class.\n",

    "## Python comes with a module that provides the base for defining Abstract Base classes(ABC) and that module name is abc. \n",
